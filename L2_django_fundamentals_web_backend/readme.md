## Level 2 – Django Fundamentals

In Level 2, I focus on building production‑style Django applications so the framework’s structure becomes clear and intuitive.

**Tech stack:**  
- Python  
- Django  
- Django Templates  
- HTML with basic CSS  
- SQLite (default Django database)

My objectives for this level are:

- Initialize a Django project and app, run the development server, and display a “Hello Django” page in the browser.  
- Configure URLs, views, and templates for core pages such as `/`, `/about/`, and `/health`.  
- Design simple models, apply migrations, and manage data through the Django admin interface.  
- Implement a small inventory‑style CRUD application (for example, an `Item` model with `name`, `sku`, `quantity`, `unit_price`) using Django forms or ModelForms.

By the end of this level, I aim to be comfortable navigating a Django codebase and implementing a complete basic CRUD workflow
