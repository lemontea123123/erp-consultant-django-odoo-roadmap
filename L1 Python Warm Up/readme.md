Level 1 is all about getting comfortable with core **Python** so later Django/Odoo code feels easy to read and modify. Focus on writing and running small scripts every day, not just reading. 

## Level 1 tasks 

1. **Variables, types, operators**  
   - Temperature converter C ↔ F (input a number, output converted value).  
   - Shopping total with discount and tax (subtotal → discount → tax → final total).  
   - Split an invoice amount into N installments (print each installment amount).

2. **Control flow (if / for / while)**  
   - Age classifier: ask age, print child/teen/adult/senior.  
   - Sum of even numbers from 1 to 200 using a loop.  
   - Simple ATM simulator: start with balance, allow withdrawals until user exits or not enough balance.

3. **Collections & functions**  
   - Grade calculator: list of scores → average → letter grade using a function.  
   - Contact book with `dict`: add, search, delete contacts by name.

4. **Mini project – CLI Student Records**  
   - Menu‑based app in terminal:  
     - Add student (name, age, scores list).  
     - List all students.  
     - Show top student by average score (highest average wins). 

## How you can use this Space

- Work through Level 1 in order: variables → control flow → collections → CLI project.  
- For each bullet above, send your code here; then it can be reviewed, improved, and extended step by step.
