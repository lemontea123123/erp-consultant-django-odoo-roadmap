# ERP Consultant – Django & Odoo Roadmap

This repository tracks my journey to become a competent ERP (Odoo) international consultant with solid technical skills in Python, Django, and Odoo development.

## Goals

- Understand core ERP and Odoo business processes (CRM, Sales, Inventory, Accounting).
- Build backend web applications with Django (CRUD, auth, simple “mini‑ERP” flows).
- Develop and extend Odoo modules (models, views, security, basic API integrations).
- Document my learning path and projects in a way that recruiters can easily review.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Django  
- Odoo Community Edition  
- PostgreSQL, Git/GitHub  

## How I Work

1. Follow a structured weekly roadmap (Python → Django → Odoo).
2. Commit small, frequent changes with clear messages.
3. Keep notes on what I learned, issues faced, and how I solved them.

This repo is mainly for learning and for showcasing my ERP‑oriented technical skills to future employers.
